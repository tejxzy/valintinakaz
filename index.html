                 My Kassie 💖<br><br>
        Since October 2, 2024, you've been my favorite chapter in the story of my life.<br>
        Every day with you feels like a page filled with laughter, warmth, and endless love.<br>
        You are my safest place when the world feels heavy, my comfort when I need peace, and the spark that makes every ordinary moment extraordinary.<br><br>
        I think about all the little things—your smile, your voice, and the countless memories we’ve already created.<br>
        Each reminds me how lucky I am to have you.<br><br>
        Through every twist and turn, you’ve been my constant. My forever choice. My heart’s true home.<br>
        And so, I ask you with all that I am: Will you always be mine? 💞<br>
        Even though I don’t have the world to offer and am still learning from my mistakes, I LOVE YOU KASSIE.
